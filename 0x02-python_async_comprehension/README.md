0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

Async comprehensions are a feature in Python that allow you to create asynchronous comprehensions, which are similar to list comprehensions but for asynchronous operations. They are used with the `async` and `await` keywords to work with asynchronous iterators, such as those returned by asynchronous generators or asynchronous iterables.

Here's the basic syntax of an async comprehension:

```python
async comprehensions
```

Here's a simple example to illustrate how async comprehensions work:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_generator():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        yield i

async def main():
    async_comp = [i async for i in async_generator()]
    print(async_comp)

asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example:

1. We define an asynchronous generator `async_generator` that yields numbers 1 through 5 with a 1-second delay between each yield.

2. In the `main` coroutine, we use an async comprehension `[i async for i in async_generator()]` to create a list of numbers generated by `async_generator`. The `await` keyword is used inside the comprehension to wait for each value to be yielded by the generator.

3. Finally, we run the `main` coroutine using `asyncio.run(main())`, which executes the async code.

When you run this code, you'll see that it waits for each value to be generated asynchronously, resulting in a list of numbers.

Async comprehensions can be used in various situations where you want to work with asynchronous data sources and apply some transformation or filtering operations to the data as it's generated. They are a powerful tool in asynchronous programming in Python.
